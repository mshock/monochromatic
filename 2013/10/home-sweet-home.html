            Okay, so you have finally installed your distro of choice, cleaned
            the whole setup, installed X.org, xterm and vim...<br />
            <br />
            <strong>And now, what?!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've asked myself this question more than I should (probably because
            I liking tweaking my desktop, but that's not the point here).<br />
            And I bet that you did too !
          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, I'll go through all the mandatory tweak that should be
            done to a clean base system. YOUR system, 'cause there is no place
            like home.<br />
            Once standing in your ~, starring at your shell prompt, you should
            be like <q>Uuuh that is life, eh!</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll not wait more to give you my secrets, but please, keep in mind
            that these are <em>MY OPINIONS</em> and I'm not asking you to agree
            with me. If you feel uncomfortable with some points, just avoid
            them. You're not here to feel bad, but to find advices on
            <strong>setting up your home!</strong>

          <h3>Window manager</h3>
          <p>
            This is the most important part of your future environment. It is
            the god that will tell all your windows where to go, how to move,
            etc.. So you can take a little time to choose a WM, it totally
            understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three types of window managers:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Floating</strong> &mdash; windows overlaps</li>
              <li><strong>Tilling</strong> &mdash; windows are arranged in tiles
              (kinda like a grid)</li>
              <li><strong>Dynamics</strong> &mdash; both floating and tilling
              are possible</li>
              <li><strong>Aliens</strong> &mdash; Go home WM, you're drunk.</li>
            </ul>
            Floating management is the management style we're all used to,
            windows are independent and you can resize/move them freely around
            your desktop.<br />
            Tilled window managers arrange the windows depending on what is
            currently on your desktop. The windows <em>CAN'T</em> overlap. When
            you create a new window, the whole set of window is rearranging to
            let the new window find a place (Not always in fact, but that's the
            idea behind tilling).<br />
            Finally, dynamic WM can switch between the two managment styles
            (most of the time, at cost of complexity and binary size, but that's
            just my opinion). Note that most tilling WM are, in fact, dynamic
            WM. But the way they manage floating windows is just so poor...<br />
            <br />
            Oh, and for the alien part, keep in mind that some WM just don't
            manage windows like that. But their behaviors are to specific to be
            described here. Just RTFM 'em.
          </p>
          <p>
            FYI, here is a non-exhaustive list of window managers I like (F =
            floating, T = tilling, D = dynamic... U DON'T SAY!)
            <ul>
              <li>cwm &mdash; Calm Window Manager (F)</li>
              <li>Ratpoison (A)</li>
              <li>ctwm (F)</li>
              <li>herbstluftwm (T) (<q>Hebrstrutoflutudobleyouhem</q>)</li>
              <li>evilwm (F)</li>
              <li>xmonad (D)</li>
              <li>spectrwm (T)</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

            Note that I <em>DIDN'T</em> mentioned AwesomeWM or openbox. beu√¢h.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have chosen your WM, go through its manpage/doc, set it up
            to look the way you want. Use stuff like <a
              href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Another+Gtk+RGBA+module+?content=100968">librgba</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/chjj/compton">compton</a> to make it
            even prettier!<br />
          </p>

            Here is a quick CWM setup, using compton and librgba:<br />
            <br />
            <a class='a_img' href='/img/2013-10-28-cwm.jpg'>
              <img class='a_img' src='/img/thumb/2013-10-28-cwm.jpg' alt='cwm screenshot'/>
            </a>
          </p>
          <p>
          Oh! A last advice, <strong>do not bind applications through your WM</strong>. Using an application like <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html">xbindkeys</a> to do that is a better idea, as it follow the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">UNIX philosophy</a>, and it will help you a lot if you want to try another WM.
          </p>
          <h3>CLI tools</h3>
          <p>
            The shell is the core of a UNIX/Linux based system. So having a
            bunch of fast, light and efficient CLI tools is a must. There are
            applications for (almost) everything you do on a daily basis with
            you computer: IRC clients, Text editor, Video games, Web browsers,
            image viewer, ...<br />
            <br />
            Okay, I agree that some of them are not really practical to use
            everyday. Mostly when it involve images (web lurking, image
            processing, gaming, ...).<br />
            But when you don't need images, <strong>unleash your
            shell!</strong><br />
            Use CLI based app for text-based task. It has many advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>ALWAYS fit your colorscheme (see <a
                href="#terminal">Terminal</a>)</li>
              <li>Focus on usability</li>
              <li>Integrate well with your whole setup</li>
              <li>This is fast as hell</li>
              <li>This is powerfull as hell</li>
              <li><strike>You look like a hacker</strike></li>
            </ul>
            I personnaly use <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, <a
              href="http://irssi.org">irssi</a> and <a
              href="http://mutt.org">mutt</a> on a daily basis.<br />
            As an alternative, take a look at <a
              href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, <a
              href="http://weechat.org/">weechat</a> and <a
              href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/re-alpine/">Alpine</a>.
            <br />
            Mandatory screenshot of the setup with those apps (and custom
            themes).<br />
