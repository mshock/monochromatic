            Okay, so you have finally installed your distro of choice, cleaned
            the whole setup, installed X.org, xterm and vim...<br />
            <br />
            <strong>And now, what?!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I've asked myself this question more than I should (probably because
            I liking tweaking my desktop, but that's not the point here).<br />
            And I bet that you did too !
          </p>
          <p>
            In this post, I'll go through all the mandatory tweak that should be
            done to a clean base system. YOUR system, 'cause there is no place
            like home.<br />
            Once standing in your ~, starring at your shell prompt, you should
            be like <q>Uuuh that is life, eh!</q>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll not wait more to give you my secrets, but please, keep in mind
            that these are <em>MY OPINIONS</em> and I'm not asking you to agree
            with me. If you feel uncomfortable with some points, just avoid
            them. You're not here to feel bad, but to find advices on
            <strong>setting up your home!</strong>

          <h3 id="wm">Window manager</h3>
          <p>
            This is the most important part of your future environment. It is
            the god that will tell all your windows where to go, how to move,
            etc.. So you can take a little time to choose a WM, it totally
            understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three types of window managers:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Floating</strong> &mdash; windows overlaps</li>
              <li><strong>Tilling</strong> &mdash; windows are arranged in tiles
              (kinda like a grid)</li>
              <li><strong>Dynamics</strong> &mdash; both floating and tilling
              are possible</li>
              <li><strong>Aliens</strong> &mdash; Go home WM, you're drunk.</li>
            </ul>
            Floating management is the management style we're all used to,
            windows are independent and you can resize/move them freely around
            your desktop.<br />
            Tilled window managers arrange the windows depending on what is
            currently on your desktop. The windows <em>CAN'T</em> overlap. When
            you create a new window, the whole set of window is rearranging to
            let the new window find a place (Not always in fact, but that's the
            idea behind tilling).<br />
            Finally, dynamic WM can switch between the two managment styles
            (most of the time, at cost of complexity and binary size, but that's
            just my opinion). Note that most tilling WM are, in fact, dynamic
            WM. But the way they manage floating windows is just so poor...<br />
            <br />
            Oh, and for the alien part, keep in mind that some WM just don't
            manage windows like that. But their behaviors are to specific to be
            described here. Just RTFM 'em.
          </p>
          <p>
            FYI, here is a non-exhaustive list of window managers I like (F =
            floating, T = tilling, D = dynamic... U DON'T SAY!)
            <ul>
              <li>cwm &mdash; Calm Window Manager (F)</li>
              <li>Ratpoison (A)</li>
              <li>ctwm (F)</li>
              <li>herbstluftwm (T) (<q>Hebrstrutoflutudobleyouhem</q>)</li>
              <li>evilwm (F)</li>
              <li>xmonad (D)</li>
              <li>spectrwm (T)</li>
              <li>...</li>
            </ul>

            Note that I <em>DIDN'T</em> mentioned AwesomeWM or openbox. beu√¢h.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have chosen your WM, go through its manpage/doc, set it up
            to look the way you want. Use stuff like <a
              href="http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Another+Gtk+RGBA+module+?content=100968">librgba</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/chjj/compton">compton</a> to make it
            even prettier!<br />
          </p>

            <br />
            <a class='a_img' href='/img/2013-10-28-cwm.jpg'>
              <img class='a_img' src='/img/thumb/2013-10-28-cwm.jpg' alt='cwm screenshot'/>
            </a>
            <span class="caption">Here is a quick CWM setup, using compton and
              librgba</span>
          </p>
          <p>
          Oh! A last advice, <strong>do not bind applications through your WM</strong>. Using an application like <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html">xbindkeys</a> to do that is a better idea, as it follow the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">UNIX philosophy</a>, and it will help you a lot if you want to try another WM.
          </p>

          <hr/>
          <h3 id="term">Terminal</h3>
          <p>
            Here we are. The terminal. The central part of the whole setup!
            <br />
            As an advanced user, you spend a lot of time within the terminal,
            so it is important to keep your terminal a pleasant place for your
            eyes.<br />
            There are, in fact, only two ways to tweak your terminal: 
            <strong>colors and font</strong>. The goal is to find the best
            readability/usability/awesomeness ratio.<br />
            I'd recommend that you start from a dark scheme, as it's better for
            your eyes by night (But that's just my opinion, light colorschemes
            can look pretty good!).<br />
            Terminals usually manage up to 256 colors, but you will use only 16
            of them:<br />
            &rarr; [0-7] for normal text<br />
            &rarr; [8-15] for bold text<br />
            Here is the color chart:
            <table>
              <tr><td></td><th>Dark</th><th>Light</th></tr>
              <tr><th>black</th><td>00</td><td>08</td></tr>
              <tr><th>red</th><td>01</td><td>09</td></tr>
              <tr><th>green</th><td>02</td><td>10</td></tr>
              <tr><th>yellow</th><td>03</td><td>11</td></tr>
              <tr><th>blue</th><td>04</td><td>12</td></tr>
              <tr><th>magenta</th><td>05</td><td>13</td></tr>
              <tr><th>cyan</th><td>06</td><td>14</td></tr>
              <tr><th>white</th><td>07</td><td>15</td></tr>
            </table>
            Now, just tweak each color to fit your perfect theme!<br />
            To do so, refer to the manual of your terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't have one, here is a list of terminal you can use:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html">rxvt-unicode</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/thestinger/termite/">termite</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.calno.com/evilvte/">evilvte</a>
              <li><a href="http://www.afterstep.org/aterm.php">aterm</a>
              <li><a href="http://freecode.com/projects/mterm">mterm</a>
            </ul>
            I have stick with rxvt-unicode (urxvt) personnally. I find it pretty
            powerfull, light and fast. Also, it can be extended in perl, which
            is great (muh URL selection).
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to terminal colors! The best way I know to change the terminal
            colorscheme, is using the X server resource database (xrdb). But it
            does not work with every terminal (it works, at least, with xterm and
            urxvt).<br />
            All you have to do, is configure your colors in a file called
            <code>~/.Xresources</code>, and source it with the command:
            <code><pre>xrdb -load ~/.Xresources</pre></code>
            For example, here is mine (screenshot at the end of the section):
            <code>
              <pre>
*background:#222222
*foreground:#e8e9ca

*color0:    #222222
*color1:    #8b3e2f
*color2:    #526f33
*color3:    #665847
*color4:    #4a708b
*color5:    #7a378b
*color6:    #528b8b
*color7:    #999999

*color8:    #4c4c4c
*color9:    #d75f00
*color10:   #cee318
*color11:   #eee685
*color12:   #9ac0cd
*color13:   #9f79ee
*color14:   #79cdcd
*color15:   #e8e9ca
              </pre>
            </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            For the font, it's quite the same, but I suggest that you search for
            the terms <em>xft font</em>, <em>bitmap fonts</em> and <em>X
              resources</em> cause it can be a little tricky to understand.
            <br />
            Quickly, there are two way to draw fonts in your terminal, with, and
            without xft. XFT allows you to draw nice fonts and scale them the
            way you want, like BitStream Vera Sans, Monospace, etc... But these
            are "slow" to draw.
            The other method is the one used by TTY, bitmap fonts. Those are
            fixed pixeled font that can look odd, but draw fastly.<br />
            Just make a choice.<br />
            To declare a XFT font:
            <code><pre>*font: xft:&lt;font name&gt;:size=&lt;size&gt;</pre></code>
            To declare a bitmap font (I'm not sure for every bit, so I'll leave
            a * where I don't know the meaning. If you can help, or if I'm wrong,
            <a href="mailto:willy@mailoo.org">Mail me</a> please):
            <code><pre>*font: -&lt;family&gt;-&lt;name&gt;-&lt;type&gt;-*-*--&lt;height&gt;-*-*-*-*-*-&lt;encoding&gt;-&lt;encoding_number&gt;</pre></code>

              Here is a small example:
              <code>
                <pre>
*font: xft:monospace:size=10
*font: -misc-tamsyn-medium-*-*--14-101-*-*-*-*-*
                </pre>
              </code>
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we have seen how to tweak the terminal, let's see what it looks
            like!
            I wrote a small script for the purpose:<br />
            <br />
            <a class='a_img' href='/img/2013-10-28-term.jpg'>
              <img class='a_img' src='/img/thumb/2013-10-28-term.jpg' alt='term screenshot'/>
            </a>
            <a class="caption" href="http://git.z3bra.org/cgit.cgi/scripts/tree/info.sh">info.sh</a><br />
          </p>

          <hr/>
          <h3 id="sh">Shell</h3>
          <p>
            right after seeing the terminal, you can't avoid it's main program:
            <strong>the shell</strong>.<br />
            If you don't know this already, the shell is the link between the
            user and the programs. It's a program you will communicate with to
            manipulate your system. An important program tough.<br />
            Choose it carefully then. Here is the main shell list:
            <ul>
              <li>sh &mdash; The historical shell</li>
              <li>bash &mdash; Improved shell, based on sh</li>
              <li>zsh &mdash; An extermly powerfull shell with a great
              completion system</li>
              <li>fish &mdash; A user friendly shell, really different from the
              above</li>
              <li>csh &mdash; The Berkeley UNIX shell</li>
              <li>tcsh &mdash; An improvement of csh</li>
            </ul>

            I personnaly use zsh because it has a feature I like, the right
            prompt. also, it's completion system is really great (argument
            completion is a good thing to have, trust me..).  <br /> 

            Anyway, I'll treat here only the "standard shell": bash <br />

            The first thing you will see from the shell is its prompt. The
            prompt is a set of characters that gives info to the user, and
            invite him to input commands. Basically, it looks like this:
            <code><pre>$ </pre></code>
            Fancy huh ?
            The prompt chars are contained in the variable <code>PS1</code> for
            sh/bash, and <code>PROMPT</code>/<code>RPROMPT</code> for zsh.
            <code>
              <pre>
$ PS1='z3bra-$ '
z3bra-$ 
              </pre>
            </code>
            (You don't have to issue the two command to make it works.)
            Take a look at the bash manpage, section "Prompting" for more info
            on how to tweak it.
            Here is my personnal prompt:
            <code>
              <pre>
<span class="Identifier">PROMPT</span>=<span class="Statement">&quot;</span>
<span class="String">%{</span><span class="PreProc">$fg_bold</span><span class="String">[yellow]%} ¬ª  </span><span class="Statement">&quot;</span>
<span class="Identifier">RPROMPT</span>=<span class="Statement">&quot;</span><span class="String">%{</span><span class="PreProc">$fg</span><span class="String">[black]%}%M:%{</span><span class="PreProc">$fg_bold</span><span class="String">[yellow]%}%~%{</span><span class="PreProc">$reset_color</span><span class="String">%}   </span><span class="Statement">&quot;</span>
              </pre>
            </code>
            <a class='a_img' href='/img/2013-10-28-shell.jpg'>
              <img class='a_img' src='/img/thumb/2013-10-28-shell.jpg' alt='shell screenshot'/>
            </a>
            <span class="caption">A few different prompts, from top to bottom:
              sh, zsh, bash, zsh</span>
          </p>

          <hr/>
          <h3 id="cli">CLI tools</h3>
          <p>
            The shell is the core of a UNIX/Linux based system. So having a
            bunch of fast, light and efficient CLI tools is a must. There are
            applications for (almost) everything you do on a daily basis with
            you computer: IRC clients, Text editor, Video games, Web browsers,
            image viewer, ...<br />
            <br />
            Okay, I agree that some of them are not really practical to use
            everyday. Mostly when it involve images (web lurking, image
            processing, gaming, ...).<br />
            But when you don't need images, <strong>unleash your
            shell!</strong><br />
            Use CLI based app for text-based task. It has many advantages:
            <ul>
              <li>ALWAYS fit your colorscheme (see <a
                href="#terminal">Terminal</a>)</li>
              <li>Focus on usability</li>
              <li>Integrate well with your whole setup</li>
              <li>This is fast as hell</li>
              <li>This is powerfull as hell</li>
              <li><strike>You look like a hacker</strike></li>
            </ul>
            I personnaly use <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, <a

          <h3 id="bar">Status bar</h3>
          <p>
            All of this is great, but I think that if you want to check the
            time, you're not willing to open a terminal, and type:
            <code><pre>date +%H:%M</pre></code>
            It's not really practical most of the time. The same can apply to
            the amount of free space, to current volume level or the number of
            unread mails you have.<br />
            That's what status bar are made for. They pick infos for you and
            display them in a thin bar on an edge of your screen.<br />

            My bar of choice is, by far, <a
              href="https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar">bar ain't recursive</a>, by
            Lemon Boy.<br />
            It is light, fast and simple. Exactly how I like it!
            the purpose is simple:<br />
            <ol>
              <li>Write a script that output a bunch of informations</li>
              <li>Pipe that script into the bar</li>
              <li>Run them within an infinite loop!</li>
            </ol>

            That is all you need. For example, if you only need the date in the bar:
            <code><pre>while :; do date; done | bar &</pre></code>
            And there you go!
            You can achieve really great looking stuff with that simple
            process:<br />

          <h3 id="setup">Integration</h3>
          <p>
            Now that we potentially have a working desktop, let make it spawn
            correctly, using ONLY on file: <code>~/.xinitrc</code>.
            <br />
            That magical file is simply a shell script that is called by default
            with <code>startx</code>.
            In fact, when you proceed this command, it does the following:
            <code><pre>$ startx ~/.xinitrc -- :0</pre></code>
            It source your ~/.xinitrc, and launch it on the Xorg server number
            0.
            To launch your wm of choice from the xinitrc, just add the command
            to launch it in the file, preceded by 'exec'. It will replace the
            current process (your shell) by the window manager, so that the
            session will terminate with your WM.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, now you have the theory. Before starting to pratice, I'll give
            you a few hints for a "good" xinitrc (yeah, I love making lists):
            <ul>
              <li>Launch ONLY session related commands</li>
              <li>Make it evolutive, so that you can spawn multiple X sessions
              at the same time</li>
              <li>Fork every command, except those that are dependent, to speed
              up the desktop spawning</li>
            </ul>
            Finally, here is my own xinitrc

          <p>
            The end, finally. That is a damn long article. I have deliberately
            not expanded some point by lack of "space". I want this article to
            end someday.<br />
            It will give you a good start to tweak your own setup, and make it
            look like what you want it to look.<br />
