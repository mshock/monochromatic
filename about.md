Hi everybody ! I am Willy Goiffon (aka 'z3bra').  
I am a french student in computer science, born in the early 90's.

### Monochromatic

This is my online blog.  Here, I'll shows you what's behind the stripes (yes, a
white skin).  I created this to have a corner on the web to share anything that
bother me, mostly about computing, and particularly about linux (or GNU/Linux
for that matters).

### Behind monochromatic

The technology behind this blog is very simple : 

* Home server &mdash; **archlinux**
* Web server &mdash; **thttpd**
* Content &mdash; **static html**
* Site generator &mdash; **/dev/null**

So yes, it is written entirely by hand in pure HTML. Why ?  Because I can.
Because I have the time. Because I like to do stuff from scratch. Because
it's.. cool ?

### Want some more ?

I am on a few other places online. You want me ? Here I am : 

* [gitorious.org](http://gitorious.org/~z3bra/) &mdash; a few project I own (no more updated)
* [irc.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net/) &mdash; mostly on #vim-fr and #archlinux-fr
* [unixhub.net](http://forum.unixhub.net/) &mdash; Both on the forum and IRC
* <span class='strike'>[quakelive.com](http://quakelive.com)</span> &mdash; Come on ID, bring linux support back..
* [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/u/z-brah/) &mdash; Well.. Does it count ?

I wish you will enjoy browsing this blog as much as I like to write it.  So,
ladies and gentlemen, have a nice day !
